# PongJS
Started working on a pure Javascript version of the classic Pong.
My primary goal with this project is to get more proficient with Javascript. Please contribute, and give tips for improvements.

#First Commit
Boilerplate stuff, a fully working implementation, some object separation to try and keep things clean.
